TEMPLATE DESIGN DECISION: Placeholder Strategy

This file uses OWNER/REPO placeholders (not generic <your-repo> syntax) because:
- Enables bulk find-and-replace for template adopters (single operation)
- CI automation can verify all placeholders are replaced (.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml)
- Results in working, copy-pastable commands after replacement
- Consistent with issue templates and other template files

Alternative considered: Generic angle-bracket syntax like <your-repository-clone-url>
Rejected because: Harder to replace in bulk, produces non-working commands,
inconsistent with other files that require real values (CI configs, package.json)

See README.md Template Setup Checklist for adoption instructions.
See OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md for detailed customization guidance.

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this repository.

## Python Version Requirements

**Important:** Contributors and maintainers must use a Python version that is **currently receiving bugfixes** from the Python core team.

### Why This Matters

- Python versions in "security fix only" phase are **not publicly installable** with security updates—they require building from source with manually applied patches
- This policy ensures all contributors can install and use the same Python version with current security updates
- It maintains consistency across development environments and CI

### Current Requirements

This project requires a Python version that is currently in "bugfix" status according to the Python core team.

See the [Python Developer's Guide - Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) page for current version status.

> **Template adopters:** Customize this section based on your project's specific Python version requirements. You may specify a minimum version (e.g., "Python 3.11+") or reference your project's own support policy.

### When to Update

Check the [Python Developer's Guide - Versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) page annually (typically around October when new Python versions are released). Update the minimum required version when upstream support changes.

**Do not default to or require unsupported Python versions in code, documentation, or configuration files.**

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your organization and repository name -->

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
cd REPO
```

### 2. Install Node.js Dependencies (for Markdown linting)

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Node.js dependencies for markdown linting scripts. Git hooks are managed by pre-commit (see step 4 below).

### Git Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit for git hooks. Configured hooks include:

- **Formatting**: Black (Python), trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer
- **Linting**: Ruff (Python), markdownlint (Markdown)
- **Data-file validation**: `check-json` (strict `.json` files only — see note below), `check-yaml`, `yamllint` (configured by `.yamllint.yml`), `actionlint` (GitHub Actions workflows)
- **Schema validation**: `check-jsonschema` and `check-metaschema` for the template's worked-example schema (`schemas/example-config.schema.json`) and its valid example data under `schemas/examples/example-config/valid/`; downstream repositories MAY add additional `check-jsonschema` hook entries for their own schema-backed file families. See [`schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md) for the worked example and the canonical downstream removal checklist.
- **Safety**: Large file detection

> **`check-json` validates strict `.json` only.** It does **not** validate `.jsonc`. JSONC files are allowed only when the consuming tool supports JSONC; downstream repositories that need stricter `.jsonc` enforcement should add **JSONC-aware tooling** rather than retrofitting `check-json`. See [`.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/json.instructions.md) for the full JSON/JSONC dialect policy and [`.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md) for YAML authoring standards.
>
> **`actionlint` first-run-on-restricted-networks caveat.** The `actionlint` pre-commit hook builds the `actionlint` binary from source on first install, which downloads a Go toolchain. On networks that block Go module downloads (corporate proxies, air-gapped environments), the first-run install can fail. CI is the shared enforcement environment, so contributors who hit a network restriction locally can rely on CI to enforce this hook. The same caveat is documented inline in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and in `.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`.

If you need to bypass hooks temporarily (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

### Markdown Linting

Run markdown linting manually:

```bash
npm run lint:md           # Lint all markdown files
npm run lint:md:nested    # Lint nested markdown blocks in docs
```

### 3. Install Python (if working with Python code)

Ensure you have a Python version that is currently receiving bugfixes (see [Python Version Requirements](#python-version-requirements) above):

```bash
python --version  # Should be a version currently receiving bugfixes
```

### 4. Install pre-commit (Globally)

**Important:** `pre-commit` is intentionally **NOT** included as a project dev dependency. Install it globally:

#### Option 1: Using pip (recommended for most users)

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

#### Option 2: Using pipx (recommended for tool isolation)

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
```

#### Why Not a Dev Dependency?

- `pre-commit` is a **development tool**, not a project runtime or test dependency
- It manages its own isolated environments for hooks (including Python tools like Black and Ruff)
- Installing it globally or via `pipx` keeps it separate from project dependencies
- This is the standard practice in the Python community
- CI workflows install `pre-commit` separately in their own steps

### 5. Install Pre-commit Hooks

After installing `pre-commit` globally, set up the hooks in your local repository:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This configures Git to automatically run pre-commit hooks before each commit.

### 6. Run Pre-commit Manually

To run all pre-commit hooks on all files (recommended before submitting a PR):

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run pre-commit on staged files only:

```bash
pre-commit run
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Pre-commit Discipline

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always run pre-commit checks before committing code.**

Pre-commit hooks are NOT optional. They enforce:

- Code formatting (Black for Python, markdownlint for Markdown)
- Linting (Ruff for Python)
- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file fixes
- Data-file validation (`check-json` for strict `.json`, `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, `actionlint` for GitHub Actions)
- Schema validation (`check-jsonschema`) for schema-backed file families where configured

> **Network and dialect notes:**
>
> - First-run hook setup may require network access (for example, `actionlint` downloads a Go toolchain on first install; see the restricted-networks caveat above).
> - `check-json` validates strict `.json` files only and does **not** validate `.jsonc`. Use **JSONC-aware tooling** if `.jsonc` files in your project warrant stricter enforcement.
> - CI runs the same hooks and is the shared enforcement environment; auto-fixes produced by the hooks **must** be committed with the related change (do not push code that fails pre-commit and rely on a follow-up "fix formatting" commit).

See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for the complete list of configured hooks. See [`.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/json.instructions.md) and [`.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md) for the JSON and YAML authoring policies that these hooks enforce.

**Workflow:**

1. Make your code changes
2. Run `pre-commit run --all-files`
3. Review and commit ALL auto-fixes as part of your change
4. Push to GitHub

**If pre-commit CI fails:**

1. Pull the latest branch
2. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally
3. Integrate the auto-fixes into the commit that introduced the change (for example, `git commit --amend` for the most recent commit, or `git commit --fixup=<sha>` followed by `git rebase -i --autosquash` for an earlier commit). Do **not** create a separate "Apply pre-commit auto-fixes" commit — auto-fixes belong in the same commit as the related change.
4. Push again (force-push is required when amending or rewriting history on a branch you have already pushed)

**CI is a safety net, not a substitute for local checks.**

### Language-Specific Guidelines

This repository includes comprehensive coding standards for multiple languages and data file formats:

- **Python:** `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md`
- **PowerShell:** `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md`
- **Terraform:** `.github/instructions/terraform.instructions.md`
- **Markdown/Documentation:** `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md`
- **JSON/JSONC:** `.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`
- **YAML:** `.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`
- **Git attributes:** `.github/instructions/gitattributes.instructions.md`

These standards apply to all contributions and are enforced by the repository's pre-commit hooks and CI workflows. AI coding agents (such as GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini) are configured to read these instruction files when generating or editing code, but enforcement of the standards on every commit comes from the tooling listed above, not from any individual agent.

### Data-File and Schema Validation

JSON, YAML, and GitHub Actions workflow files are first-class file types in this template. Contributor expectations:

- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before opening a PR.
- JSON files **must** pass `check-json` (strict `.json` only — `.jsonc` is intentionally not validated; see the dialect note above).
- YAML files **must** pass `check-yaml` and `yamllint` (configured by `.yamllint.yml`).
- GitHub Actions workflow files **must** pass `actionlint`.
- Schema-backed files **must** pass `check-jsonschema` (and the schema itself **must** pass `check-metaschema` where wired).
- The schema example contracts under `schemas/examples/<schema>/{valid,invalid}/` are tested by [`tests/test_schema_examples.py`](tests/test_schema_examples.py); when changing a schema or its example fixtures, run `pytest tests/test_schema_examples.py -v` to confirm the contract still holds.

See [`schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md) for schema conventions and the canonical downstream removal checklist for the worked example.

### CI Workflows

This repository includes several GitHub Actions workflows that run automatically:

| Workflow | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python CI | `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` | Runs pre-commit, mypy (type checking), and pytest on Python files |
| Auto-fix Pre-commit | `.github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml` | Automatically commits pre-commit auto-fixes on pushes to `copilot/**` branches authored by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` (optional) |
| Markdown Lint | `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml` | Validates markdown formatting |
| PowerShell CI | `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml` | Runs PSScriptAnalyzer on PowerShell files |
| Data CI | `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml` | Runs `check-json`, `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, `actionlint`, `check-jsonschema`, and `check-metaschema` against JSON/YAML/GitHub Actions data files |

The **Auto-fix Pre-commit** workflow is scoped specifically to the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent: it triggers only on pushes to `copilot/**` branches authored by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`, and automatically commits any pre-commit auto-fixes back onto that branch. Human-authored PRs and PRs on non-`copilot/**` branches are not affected; their authors must run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally and integrate the fixes themselves before pushing.

### Workflow Version Pinning

When editing files under `.github/workflows/`, follow the [**Workflow Version Pinning**](.github/copilot-instructions.md#workflow-version-pinning) rule in the repo-wide constitution. In short:

- Keep third-party action versions directly in `uses:` lines (for example, `actions/checkout@v6`) so Dependabot can update them.
- Do **not** mirror a `uses:` version into a workflow-level `env:` variable, comment, cache key, file path, or shell literal — Dependabot will not rewrite those mirrors, and they will silently drift.
- For tool versions that Dependabot does not manage (for example, `terraform_version` or `tflint_version` passed to setup actions), a workflow-level `env:` value is a fine single source of truth across multiple steps.
- If a Dependabot-managed dependency genuinely cannot be expressed without duplication, add a narrowly scoped `.github/dependabot.yml` `ignore:` entry with a YAML comment explaining why.

See the deep link above for the full rule, including the wrapper-action vs. installed-tool distinction and concrete examples from this repository.

This repository is a template designed for projects that use GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development.

### Understanding the Instruction Files

The `.github/instructions/` directory contains coding standards that guide GitHub Copilot's code generation:

- **`docs.instructions.md`** - Documentation and Markdown writing standards
- **`powershell.instructions.md`** - PowerShell coding conventions (OTBS style, v1.0 compatibility patterns)
- **`python.instructions.md`** - Python coding standards (PEP 8, type hints, testing patterns)

These instruction files are automatically applied by GitHub Copilot based on the file patterns specified in each file's front matter.

### Customizing for Your Project

You can customize these instruction files for your project's specific conventions:

1. Edit the instruction files to match your team's coding standards
2. Remove instruction files for languages you don't use
3. Add new instruction files for additional languages as needed

### First-Time Setup Validation

After creating a new repository from this template, see the [Validating Your New Repository](README.md#validating-your-new-repository) section in the README for guidance on verifying your setup.
