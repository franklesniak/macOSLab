# Getting Started: Adding Template Features to an Existing Repository

This guide walks you through adopting features from `franklesniak/copilot-repo-template` into your **existing repository**. Unlike creating a new repository from a template, integrating template features into an existing project requires careful planning to avoid conflicts with your current configuration.

> **Looking to create a new repository?** See [GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md](GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md) instead.

**Recommendation:** Read through this entire guide before starting. This helps you plan which features to adopt and in what order.

**Estimated time to complete:** 15-60 minutes (varies based on scope of adoption)

---

## Prerequisites

### Existing Repository Requirements

Before adopting template features, ensure your repository meets these requirements:

- [ ] **GitHub remote configured:** Your repository must be hosted on GitHub
- [ ] **Clean working tree:** All changes should be committed (`git status` shows no pending changes)
- [ ] **Working on a feature branch:** Recommended to avoid issues with your main branch

**Create a feature branch for this work:**

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/your/repository

# Ensure you're on your main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create a feature branch for template adoption
git checkout -b feature/adopt-template-features
```

### Tools Needed

The tools you need depend on which features you plan to adopt:

| Feature | Required Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Templates, PR Template, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot | None (GitHub web interface only) |
| Copilot Instructions | None |
| Markdown Linting | Node.js |
| Pre-commit Hooks | Python, pre-commit |
| Python CI Workflow | Python |
| PowerShell CI Workflow | PowerShell |

**Verify your installations:**

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Check Git version
git --version

# Check Python version (if adopting Python features or pre-commit)
# Python 3.9+ is required for pre-commit hooks and CI workflows
python --version

# Check pip version (if adopting Python features or pre-commit)
python -m pip --version

# Check Node.js version (if adopting markdown linting)
node --version
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
# Check Git version
git --version

# Check Python version (if adopting Python features or pre-commit)
# Python 3.9+ is required for pre-commit hooks and CI workflows
python3 --version

# Check pip version (if adopting Python features or pre-commit)
pip3 --version

# Check Node.js version (if adopting markdown linting)
node --version
```

> **Need to install these tools?** See the [Prerequisites section in GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md](GETTING_STARTED_NEW_REPO.md#prerequisites) for detailed installation instructions.

## Planning Your Adoption

### Feature Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to decide which features to adopt based on complexity and dependencies:

| Feature | Files Involved | Dependencies | Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Issue Templates | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | None | Low |
| PR Template | `.github/pull_request_template.md` | None | Low |
| Copilot Instructions | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/` | None | Low |
| CODEOWNERS | `.github/CODEOWNERS` | None | Low |
| Dependabot | `.github/dependabot.yml` | None | Low |
| Security Policy | `SECURITY.md` | None | Low |
| VS Code Settings | `.vscode/settings.json` | None | Low |
| Markdown Linting | `.markdownlint.jsonc`, `package.json`, npm scripts | Node.js | Medium |
| Pre-commit Hooks | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Python, pre-commit | Medium |
| PowerShell CI Workflow | `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml` | PowerShell, Pester | Medium |
| PSScriptAnalyzer Config | `.github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` | PowerShell | Low |
| Python CI Workflow | `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` | Python project structure | High |
| Agent Instruction Files | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` | Adopt `.github/copilot-instructions.md` first | Low |

### Recommended Adoption Order

For the smoothest experience, adopt features in this order:

1. **Simple standalone files first** — CODEOWNERS, Dependabot, Security Policy
2. **Issue/PR templates** — Low complexity, immediate usability improvements
3. **Copilot instructions** — Enhances AI-assisted development
4. **Linting configurations** — Establishes code quality standards
5. **CI workflows** — Most complex, most dependencies; adopt last

> **Tip:** You don't need to adopt everything. Pick the features that provide the most value for your project.

### Repo Layout Examples

Before starting adoption, understand how your repository is structured. Here are two common patterns:

**Root-Only Repo (Single Configuration):**

A repository with a single Terraform or application configuration:

```text
my-project/
├── .github/
│   ├── copilot-instructions.md
│   ├── instructions/
│   └── workflows/
├── main.tf              # Primary configuration
├── variables.tf         # Input variables
├── outputs.tf           # Output values
├── versions.tf          # Provider version constraints
├── .terraform.lock.hcl  # Dependency lock file
└── README.md
```

**Module-Based Repo:**

A repository containing reusable modules with examples and tests:

```text
my-modules/
├── .github/
│   ├── copilot-instructions.md
│   ├── instructions/
│   └── workflows/
├── modules/
│   └── vpc/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       ├── outputs.tf
│       ├── versions.tf
│       └── README.md
├── examples/
│   └── basic-vpc/
│       ├── main.tf
│       └── README.md
├── tests/
│   └── vpc.tftest.hcl
└── README.md
```

Choose your adoption approach based on your repository's structure.

## Getting the Template Files

Choose the method that works best for your situation:

### Option A: Clone Template Separately (Recommended)

This method gives you easy access to all template files for reference and copying.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Create a temporary directory
mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\template-source
cd $env:USERPROFILE\template-source

# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/franklesniak/copilot-repo-template.git
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
# Create a temporary directory
mkdir ~/template-source
cd ~/template-source

# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/franklesniak/copilot-repo-template.git
```

### Option B: Download as ZIP

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/franklesniak/copilot-repo-template>
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract to a known location (e.g., `~/template-source/` or `C:\template-source\`)

### Option C: Use GitHub's Web Interface

Best for adopting just one or two files:

1. Navigate to the file you want in the template repository
2. Click the file to view its contents
3. Click the **Raw** button to see the raw content
4. Copy the content and paste into a new file in your repository

### Files to Skip (Example/Demonstration Code)

The template repository includes example Python source code and tests that demonstrate coding standards. These files are intended for new repositories created from the template and should **NOT** be copied to existing repositories:

| File/Directory | Purpose | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/copilot_repo_template/` | Example Python package demonstrating coding standards | Do not copy |
| `tests/test_example.py` | Example pytest tests for the demo package | Do not copy |
| `tests/__init__.py` | Package marker with template-specific docstring | Do not copy |
| `pyproject.toml` | Configured for the template's example package | Copy only if you need a starting point, then heavily customize |

If you already have Python tests in your existing repository, these template example files would conflict with your existing setup.

**What you SHOULD copy:**

- `.github/` directory contents (workflows, instructions, templates)
- Configuration files (`.markdownlint.jsonc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- Community health files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- `templates/` directory (reference templates for starting new test files)

If your existing repository lacks Python project structure and you want to adopt the template's Python CI workflow, see the [Python CI Workflow](#python-ci-workflow) section below for guidance on setting up your own `pyproject.toml` and test structure.

---

## Adopting Simple Standalone Files

These files can be copied directly with minimal modifications.

### CODEOWNERS

The CODEOWNERS file automatically assigns reviewers to pull requests based on file paths.

**Location:** `.github/CODEOWNERS`

**Steps:**

1. **If you don't have a CODEOWNERS file:**
   - Copy `.github/CODEOWNERS` from the template to your `.github/` directory
   - Replace `@OWNER` with your GitHub username or team name

2. **If you already have a CODEOWNERS file:**
   - Review the template's file for patterns you may want to add
   - Merge entries manually, keeping your existing ownership rules

**Example customization:**

```text
# Default owners for everything in the repo
* @your-username

# Workflow files require maintainer review
.github/workflows/ @your-username

# Copilot instructions require maintainer review
.github/copilot-instructions.md @your-username
.github/instructions/ @your-username
```

### Dependabot

Dependabot automatically creates pull requests to update your dependencies.

**Location:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

**Steps:**

1. **If you don't have a dependabot.yml file:**
   - Copy `.github/dependabot.yml` from the template
   - Remove ecosystems you don't use:
     - Remove the `npm` section if you don't use Node.js
     - Remove the `pip` section if you don't use Python
     - Keep the `github-actions` section (recommended for all repositories)

2. **If you already have a dependabot.yml file:**
   - Review the template's grouping strategy (groups minor/patch updates)
   - Consider adopting the commit message prefix convention (`chore(deps)`)
   - Merge any ecosystems you want to add

**Example: Dependabot for a Python-only project:**

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Python dependencies (pyproject.toml)
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      pip-minor-patch:
        patterns:
          - "*"
        update-types:
          - "minor"
          - "patch"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore(deps)"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10

  # GitHub Actions (workflows)
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      actions-minor-patch:
        patterns:
          - "*"
        update-types:
          - "minor"
          - "patch"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore(deps)"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

### Security Policy

The security policy tells users how to report security vulnerabilities.

**Location:** `SECURITY.md` (repository root)

**Steps:**

1. **If you don't have a SECURITY.md file:**
   - Copy `SECURITY.md` from the template to your repository root
   - Replace `[security contact email]` with your email address
   - Or remove the email option and use only GitHub Security Advisories (for public repositories)

2. **If you already have a SECURITY.md file:**
   - Review the template's structure for ideas
   - Consider adding sections you may be missing (response timeline, disclosure policy)

> **Note:** Private vulnerability reporting via GitHub Security Advisories is only available for **public repositories**. If your repository is private, you must provide an email contact in SECURITY.md. Use a dedicated security email (e.g., `security@your-domain.com`) rather than a personal email when possible.

### LICENSE File

The template includes an MIT License file with the template author's name as the copyright holder.

**Location:** `LICENSE`

**Steps:**

1. **If you want to use the MIT License:**
   - Copy `LICENSE` from the template to your repository root
   - Replace `Frank Lesniak` with your name or organization name (the copyright holder)
   - Optionally update the copyright year to the current year or your project's start year

2. **If you already have a LICENSE file:**
   - Keep your existing license—no action needed

3. **If you want a different license type:**
   - See the [License Customization](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md#license-customization) section in `OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md` for guidance on Apache 2.0, proprietary licenses, and updating all license references across your project

### Code of Conduct

The code of conduct defines community standards and expectations for behavior.

**Location:** `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (repository root)

**Steps:**

1. **If you don't have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file:**
   - Copy `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` from the template to your repository root
   - Replace `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` with an email address, form URL, or other contact method for reporting violations

2. **If you already have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file:**
   - Review the template's structure for ideas
   - Consider adding sections you may be missing (enforcement ladder, scope definition)

> **Note:** Small personal projects or projects that don't accept external contributions may choose to delete this file entirely. The placeholder check workflow treats the file as optional.

### VS Code Settings

The `.vscode/settings.json` file customizes VS Code behavior for your repository. The template includes a placeholder window title.

**Location:** `.vscode/settings.json`

**Steps:**

1. **If you don't have a `.vscode/settings.json` file:**
   - Copy `.vscode/settings.json` from the template to your `.vscode/` directory
   - Replace the `window.title` value with your repository name

2. **If you already have a `.vscode/settings.json` file:**
   - Review the template's file for settings you may want to add
   - Consider adding the `window.title` setting for easier workspace identification

**Example customization:**

```json
{
    "window.title": "my-awesome-project"
}
```

---

## Adopting Issue Templates

The template includes three issue templates: bug reports, feature requests, and documentation issues.

### Full Adoption (Recommended if You Have None)

If your repository doesn't have issue templates, adopt the full set:

1. Copy the entire `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory to your repository's `.github/` directory

2. **Update `config.yml`:** Replace `OWNER/REPO` placeholders with your actual organization/username and repository name:

   ```yaml
   # Before
   url: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md

   # After
   url: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

3. **Update `bug_report.yml`:** Replace `OWNER/REPO` placeholders in the security-notice URLs (the Security tab and `SECURITY.md` links). Both URLs use the same `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/...` form as `config.yml`. If you also adopt and keep `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` (an optional adoption step), CI will fail until this substitution is made; if you do not adopt that workflow or you remove it after initial setup, no CI guardrail catches a missed substitution and you must verify the replacement manually.

   **GHES adopters:** In both `config.yml` and `bug_report.yml`, also replace `github.com` with your GHES host (e.g., `github.company.com`). The host substitution is not validated by `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml`, but inline YAML comments above the affected blocks (in both files) note the requirement.

4. **Review and customize each template** (see [Customizing Area Dropdowns](#customizing-area-dropdowns))

### Partial Adoption (If You Have Existing Templates)

If you already have issue templates:

1. Compare the template files with your existing templates
2. Copy specific templates you want to add (e.g., just `documentation_issue.yml`)
3. If you have a `config.yml`, merge the `contact_links` sections
4. **If you adopt `bug_report.yml`** (in whole or in part), remember to replace `OWNER/REPO` in the security-notice URLs — and, on GHES, the `github.com` host as well.

### Customizing Area Dropdowns

The issue templates include an "Area" dropdown with default options. Customize for your project:

**In `bug_report.yml` and `feature_request.yml`:**

```yaml
# Default options - modify for your project
options:
  - Python
  - PowerShell
  - Markdown / Documentation
  - GitHub Actions / CI
  - Cross-language / Integration
  - Cross-cutting / Repo-wide
  - Other (describe/specify in Additional Context)
```

**Example for a JavaScript/TypeScript project:**

```yaml
options:
  - Frontend (React)
  - Backend (Node.js)
  - API
  - Documentation
  - CI/CD
  - Other (describe in Additional Context)
```

> **Tip:** Update the Area dropdown in both template files to keep them consistent.

### Creating Required Labels

The issue templates use labels that should exist in your repository:

**Default GitHub labels (already exist in most repositories):**

- `bug` — Used by bug_report.yml
- `enhancement` — Used by feature_request.yml
- `documentation` — Used by documentation_issue.yml

**Optional label to create:**

The templates include a commented-out `triage` label. To use it:

**Windows (PowerShell) / macOS / Linux:**

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh label create triage --description "Needs triage" --color "d4c5f9"
```

**Or via GitHub web UI:**

1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Issues** or **Pull requests**
3. Above the list, click **Labels**
4. Click **New label**
5. Under "Label name", type `triage`
6. Under "Description", type `Needs triage`
7. Edit the color hexadecimal number to `d4c5f9` (light purple)
8. Click **Create label**

After creating the label, uncomment the `- triage` line in each issue template.

---

## Adopting PR Template

The pull request template provides a checklist for contributors.

### Simple Adoption

If you don't have a PR template:

1. Copy `.github/pull_request_template.md` to your `.github/` directory
2. Review the sections and remove any that don't apply to your project

### Customization Needed

Review these sections and modify as needed:

**Language-specific sections:**

- **Python-Specific:** Remove if your project doesn't use Python
- **PowerShell-Specific:** Remove if your project doesn't use PowerShell

**Pre-commit section:**

- Remove the "Pre-commit Verification" section if you're not adopting pre-commit hooks

**Contributing guidelines link:**

The template uses an absolute URL with the `OWNER/REPO` placeholder for the contributing guidelines link in the PR template:

```markdown
[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your actual organization and repository name. If you also adopt and keep `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` (an optional adoption step), CI will fail until this substitution is made; if you do not adopt that workflow or you remove it after initial setup, no CI guardrail catches a missed substitution and you must verify the replacement manually. If your CONTRIBUTING.md is in a different location, update the path inside the URL accordingly. **GHES adopters** must additionally replace `github.com` with their GHES host (e.g., `github.company.com`); the host substitution is not validated by `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` even when that workflow is kept. Absolute URLs are required in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` and `.github/pull_request_template.md`; see the **Issue and PR templates** carve-out in `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md` and the [Pull Request Template Customization](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md#contributing-guidelines-link) section in `OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md`.

### Merging with Existing PR Template

If you already have a PR template:

1. **Keep your existing structure** — Don't replace what's working
2. **Add relevant checklist items** from the template that you're missing
3. **Consider adopting:**
   - The "Type of Change" section (if you don't have one)
   - Language-specific checklists
   - The pre-commit verification checkbox (if adopting pre-commit)

**Example: Adding a "Type of Change" section to your existing template:**

```markdown
## Type of Change

<!-- Check all that apply -->

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Dependencies update
- [ ] Configuration/tooling change
```

---

## Adopting GitHub Copilot Instructions

GitHub Copilot Instructions guide AI-assisted development by providing project-specific coding standards and rules. The template includes both a main instructions file and language-specific instruction files.

### Main Instructions File

**Location:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

This file serves as the "constitution" for all Copilot suggestions in your repository. It contains:

- Safety and security rules (non-negotiable)
- Pre-commit discipline requirements
- Language-specific guideline references
- Linting and testing configurations

**Steps:**

1. Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to your `.github/` directory

2. **Customize the "Source of Truth" section** — Point to your project's authoritative documentation:

   ```markdown
   ## Source of Truth

   > **Customize this section** for your project. Point to your authoritative specification or design document. Example:
   >
   > - Read **`docs/spec/requirements.md`** before making changes.
   > - If any instruction here conflicts with the spec, **the spec wins**.
   ```

3. **Update the modular instructions table** — Modify to reflect your project's languages and cross-cutting rules:

   ```markdown
   | Scope | Instruction File | Applies To |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Git attributes | `.github/instructions/gitattributes.instructions.md` | `**/.gitattributes` |
   | Markdown/Docs | `.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md` | `**/*.md` |
   | Python | `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` | `**/*.py` |
   | PowerShell | `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md` | `**/*.ps1` |
   ```

4. **Review and modify:**
   - **Pre-commit section** — Update if using different tools or workflows
   - **Testing section** — Update for your test frameworks and locations

5. **Update linting and testing tables** — Modify to reflect your project's languages:
   - **Linting Configurations table** — Remove the PSScriptAnalyzer row if not using PowerShell
   - **Testing Tools table** — Remove rows for languages you're not using (Python row if not using Python, PowerShell row if not using PowerShell)

### Modular Instructions

**Location:** `.github/instructions/`

These files use `applyTo` front matter to automatically apply to matching file patterns:

```yaml
---
applyTo: "**/*.py"
description: "Python coding standards for this repository"
---
```

**Available instruction files:**

| File | Purpose | Recommended For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gitattributes.instructions.md` | `.gitattributes` rules for byte-exact text artifacts | All projects |
| `docs.instructions.md` | Markdown/documentation standards | All projects |
| `python.instructions.md` | Python coding standards | Python projects |
| `powershell.instructions.md` | PowerShell coding standards | PowerShell projects |
| `terraform.instructions.md` | Terraform coding standards | Terraform/IaC projects |

**Adoption options:**

1. **Full adoption:** Copy the entire `.github/instructions/` directory
2. **Selective adoption:** Copy only the files relevant to your project's languages

### Merging with Existing Copilot Instructions

If you already have a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file:

1. **Review both files** — Compare your existing instructions with the template

2. **Merge safety rules** — The template's non-negotiable safety rules are security-focused:
   - No secrets in code or repo
   - Treat all external input as untrusted
   - Allowlisted file access only

   Consider adopting these if not already present.

3. **Merge language guidelines** — Add references to language instruction files

4. **Keep your project-specific guidance** — Preserve any custom rules specific to your project

### Creating Instructions for Other Languages

If your project uses languages not covered by the template (JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.):

1. Use an existing instruction file as a template

2. Create a new file following the naming pattern: `{language}.instructions.md`

3. Add the `applyTo` front matter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   applyTo: "**/*.ts"
   description: "TypeScript coding standards for this repository"
   ---
   ```

4. Define your project's coding standards for that language

5. Update the language table in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Agent Instruction Files (Multi-Platform Support)

The template includes three agent instruction files at the repository root to support multi-platform AI coding agents:

| File | Target Agent(s) |
| --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code, GitHub Copilot coding agent |
| `AGENTS.md` | OpenAI Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot coding agent |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini Code Assist, GitHub Copilot coding agent |

These files are thin entry points for their respective AI coding platforms. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` remains canonical, and the root agent files keep only a minimal inline summary of the highest-priority shared rules plus any platform-specific guidance.

**Adoption steps:**

1. **Copy agent files** — Copy the agent files you want from the template repository to your repository root
2. **Update to match your project** — If you customized `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, keep the copied agent files limited to a minimal inline summary of the highest-priority shared rules plus any platform-specific notes you need
3. **Remove unneeded files** — Delete agent files for platforms you do not use

---

## Adopting Markdown Linting

Markdown linting enforces consistent formatting across your documentation. The template uses markdownlint-cli2 with a configuration optimized for auto-fixable rules.

**Required files:**

- `.markdownlint.jsonc` — Linting rules configuration
- `package.json` — npm scripts and dependencies

**Optional files:**

- `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml` — CI workflow
- `.github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js` — Lints markdown in code blocks

### If You Don't Have package.json

If your project doesn't have a `package.json`:

1. Copy `package.json` from the template

2. Update the metadata for your project:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-project-name",
     "description": "Your project description",
     "author": "Your Name"
   }
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   **Windows (PowerShell) / macOS / Linux:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### If You Already Have package.json

If your project already has a `package.json`:

1. **Merge the scripts section** — Add these scripts:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "lint:md": "markdownlint-cli2 \"**/*.md\" \"#node_modules\"",
       "lint:md:nested": "node .github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Merge devDependencies** — Add these packages (check template for current versions):

   ```json
   {
     "devDependencies": {
       "markdownlint": "^0.40.0",
       "markdownlint-cli2": "^0.20.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** If adopting the nested markdown linting script, also add `glob`, `jsonc-parser`, and `markdown-it`.

3. Run `npm install` to install the new dependencies

### Copying the Configuration

1. Copy `.markdownlint.jsonc` to your repository root

2. Review the rules and adjust for your project's preferences. Key configurable rules:

   | Rule | Default | Purpose |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `MD003` | ATX style (`#`) | Heading style |
   | `MD004` | Dashes | Unordered list marker |
   | `MD029` | Ordered (1. 2. 3.) | Ordered list prefix |
   | `MD035` | `---` | Horizontal rule style |

3. **Optional:** Copy `.github/scripts/lint-nested-markdown.js` if you have markdown embedded in code blocks (common in documentation-heavy projects)

   > **Tip:** See [Nested Markdown Linting Configuration](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md#nested-markdown-linting-configuration) for details on using this script.

### Testing Markdown Linting

Run the linter to verify configuration:

**Windows (PowerShell) / macOS / Linux:**

```bash
npm run lint:md
```

If many errors appear, you have three options:

1. **Fix the files** — Run with `--fix` to auto-correct:

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules" --fix
   ```

2. **Adjust rules** — Modify `.markdownlint.jsonc` to match your project's existing style

3. **Disable specific rules** — Set rules to `false` in the configuration

---

## Adopting Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automated checks before each commit, catching issues early in the development process.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python installed (3.9+)
- pre-commit installed (see installation steps below; pipx/Homebrew installs make `pre-commit` available via PATH, pip installs require module invocation)

> **Why pipx is recommended:**
>
> When you install Python packages with CLI tools using `pip`, the executables are placed in a `Scripts` folder (Windows) or `bin` folder (macOS/Linux) that may not be in your system PATH. This can cause "command not found" errors.
>
> `pipx` addresses this by installing Python CLI tools in isolated environments and exposing their executables from a single, well-defined binary directory. To make that directory available on the command line, you must run `pipx ensurepath` once (and restart your shell); after that, new tools installed with `pipx` will typically be usable without additional PATH changes. This is the [official recommendation from the pre-commit project](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
>
> If the `pipx` command itself is not yet on your PATH (for example, just after installation on Windows), you can invoke it via the Python module instead, such as `python -m pipx ensurepath` on Windows or `python3 -m pipx ensurepath` on macOS/Linux/FreeBSD for the initial setup.
>
> If you prefer to use `pip`, you can invoke pre-commit as a Python module using `python -m pre_commit` (Windows) or `python3 -m pre_commit` (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD) instead of the `pre-commit` command directly.

**Install pre-commit:**

**Windows (PowerShell):**

**Option 1: Using pipx (recommended):**

```powershell
# First, upgrade pip to the latest version (recommended)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install pipx
python -m pip install pipx

# Configure PATH (use module invocation in case pipx isn't on PATH yet)
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

Then install pre-commit:

```powershell
# Use module invocation to ensure it works even if pipx isn't on PATH
python -m pipx install pre-commit
```

> **Note:** You need to restart your PowerShell window (or open a new one) before running `pre-commit` directly by name, because PATH changes only apply to new shells. Using `python -m pipx` avoids needing `pipx` on PATH and lets you install packages in the same session, but `pipx run pre-commit` runs from a temporary environment and should not be used for `pre-commit install` (it can create hooks that reference a non-existent interpreter).

**Option 2: Using pip:**

```powershell
# First, upgrade pip to the latest version (recommended)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Then install pre-commit
python -m pip install pre-commit
```

> **Note:** When using pip, the `pre-commit` command may not be recognized because Python's `Scripts` folder is not always added to PATH. Use `python -m pre_commit` instead of `pre-commit` for all commands.

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

**Option 1: Using pipx (recommended):**

> **Important (PEP 668 systems):** On newer Linux distributions (Ubuntu 23.04+, Fedora 38+) and some macOS configurations, `python3 -m pip install` commands fail with an `externally-managed-environment` error. If you're on one of these systems, **skip the pip commands below** and install pipx via your OS package manager instead:
>
> - Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
> - Fedora: `sudo dnf install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
> - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
>
> After running `pipx ensurepath`, restart your terminal, then proceed to the "Then install pre-commit" step below.

If pip works on your system:

```bash
# First, upgrade pip to the latest version (recommended)
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install pipx
python3 -m pip install pipx

# Configure PATH (use module invocation in case pipx isn't on PATH yet)
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Then install pre-commit:

```bash
# Use module invocation to ensure it works even if pipx isn't on PATH
python3 -m pipx install pre-commit
```

> **Note:** You need to restart your terminal (or open a new one) before running `pre-commit` directly by name, because PATH changes only apply to new shells. Using `python3 -m pipx` avoids needing `pipx` on PATH and lets you install packages in the same session, but `pipx run pre-commit` runs from a temporary environment and should not be used for `pre-commit install` (it can create hooks that reference a non-existent interpreter).

**Option 2: Using Homebrew (macOS only):**

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

**Option 3: Using pip:**

> **Important (PEP 668 systems):** On newer Linux distributions (Ubuntu 23.04+, Fedora 38+) and some macOS configurations, `python3 -m pip install` commands fail with an `externally-managed-environment` error. If you're on one of these systems, **do not use pip**—use Option 1 (pipx via OS package manager) instead:
>
> - Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
> - Fedora: `sudo dnf install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
> - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`
>
> After running `pipx ensurepath`, restart your terminal, then run `pipx install pre-commit`.

If pip works on your system:

```bash
# First, upgrade pip to the latest version (recommended)
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Then install pre-commit
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
```

> **Note:** When using pip, the `pre-commit` command may not be recognized if Python's `bin` folder is not in your PATH. Use `python3 -m pre_commit` instead of `pre-commit` for all commands.

### If You Don't Have Pre-commit Configured

If your project doesn't have a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

1. Copy `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to your repository root

2. Review the hooks and remove those for languages you don't use:

   ```yaml
   # Remove this section if not using Python
   - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
     rev: 26.1.0
     hooks:
       - id: black
         args: [--line-length=100]

   # Remove this section if not using Python
   - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
     rev: v0.14.14
     hooks:
       - id: ruff-check
         args: [--fix, --line-length=100]
   ```

3. Install the hooks:

   **If you installed with pipx (Windows):**

   ```powershell
   pre-commit install
   ```

   **If you installed with pipx or Homebrew (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD):**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

   **If you installed with pip (Windows):**

   ```powershell
   python -m pre_commit install
   ```

   **If you installed with pip (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m pre_commit install
   ```

4. Run all hooks to verify:

   **If you installed with pipx or Homebrew:**

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

   **If you installed with pip (Windows):**

   ```powershell
   python -m pre_commit run --all-files
   ```

   **If you installed with pip (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files
   ```

### If You Already Have Pre-commit Configured

If your project already uses pre-commit:

1. Compare your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the template

2. Consider adding hooks you may be missing:

   **General hooks (recommended for all projects):**
   - `trailing-whitespace`
   - `end-of-file-fixer`
   - `check-yaml`
   - `check-added-large-files`

   **Python hooks:**
   - `black` (formatting)
   - `ruff` (linting)

   **Markdown hooks:**
   - `markdownlint-cli2`

3. Update hook versions if the template has newer ones

4. Run all hooks to verify:

   **If you installed with pipx or Homebrew (same command on all platforms/shells):**

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

   **If you installed with pip (Windows):**

   ```powershell
   python -m pre_commit run --all-files
   ```

   **If you installed with pip (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files
   ```

### Customizing Hooks

**Adjust line length for Black/Ruff:**

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/psf/black
  rev: 26.1.0
  hooks:
    - id: black
      args: [--line-length=88]  # Change from 100 to 88 (Black's default)
```

**Add hooks for other languages:**

```yaml
# Example: Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
  rev: v3.1.0
  hooks:
    - id: prettier
      types_or: [javascript, typescript, json, yaml]
```

**Handling hook environment issues:**

| Issue | Platform | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` not recognized | Windows | Use `python -m pre_commit` instead of `pre-commit`, or reinstall using `pipx` |
| `pre-commit` command not found | macOS/Linux | Use `python3 -m pre_commit` instead of `pre-commit`, or reinstall using `pipx` or Homebrew |
| `pip` not recognized | Windows | Use `python -m pip` instead of `pip` |
| `pip` not found | macOS/Linux | Use `python3 -m pip` instead of `pip` |
| `externally-managed-environment` error | Linux/macOS | Install pipx via OS package manager (`sudo apt install pipx`, `sudo dnf install pipx`, or `brew install pipx`) then run `pipx ensurepath` and use `pipx install pre-commit` (or `python3 -m pipx install pre-commit`) |
| Python not found | Windows | Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH" |
| Hooks fail to initialize | All | See [Hook initialization troubleshooting](#hook-initialization-troubleshooting) below |

### Hook initialization troubleshooting

If hooks fail to initialize, follow these steps based on your installation method:

**If `pre-commit` is on your PATH:**

Run the following to clear the cache and reinstall hooks:

```bash
pre-commit clean
pre-commit install
```

**If `pre-commit` is NOT on your PATH:**

First, fix your PATH configuration or use module invocation:

- **pipx users:** Run `pipx ensurepath` (or `python -m pipx ensurepath` / `python3 -m pipx ensurepath` if `pipx` is not on your PATH) and restart your terminal, then run the commands above.

  > **Note:** Do not use `pipx run pre-commit install` because it runs from a temporary environment and can create hooks that reference a non-existent interpreter.

- **Homebrew users (macOS):** Ensure your Homebrew `bin` directory (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`) is on your PATH, then run the commands above.

- **pip users:** Use module invocation:

  Windows (PowerShell):

  ```powershell
  python -m pre_commit clean
  python -m pre_commit install
  ```

  macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pre_commit clean
  python3 -m pre_commit install
  ```

## Adopting JSON/YAML Toolchain

If you are adopting the template's JSON/YAML support into an existing repository, work through the following steps. Each step is independent — adopt only the pieces you need.

> **Do not duplicate full JSON/YAML policy here.** The authoritative authoring rules live in [`.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/json.instructions.md) and [`.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md). Link to those files from your own documentation rather than copying their contents.

### 1. Start with the Instruction Files

Copy the JSON and YAML authoring guides into your repository. They are small, self-contained, and apply repository-wide:

- `.github/instructions/json.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/yaml.instructions.md`

If your repository already has equivalents, merge the rules rather than overwriting. Pay particular attention to the dialect policy (strict `.json` vs. `.jsonc`, no JSON5 by default) and the schema-validation tier guidance.

### 2. Add `.yamllint.yml`

Copy `.yamllint.yml` to the repository root. It extends `default`, enforces 2-space indentation, sets the line-length warning at 120 characters, and disables `truthy.check-keys` so unquoted GitHub Actions `on:` keys are accepted.

If you already have a yamllint configuration, reconcile its rules with the YAML authoring guide rather than replacing your file wholesale.

### 3. Add or Merge Pre-commit Hooks

Add the following hooks to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (or merge them with your existing configuration) so the JSON/YAML toolchain runs locally and in CI:

- `check-json` — **must** be scoped to strict `.json` files only. Use `files: \.json$` so the hook does **not** run against `.jsonc`.
- `check-yaml` — basic YAML syntax check.
- `yamllint` — style and structural checks driven by `.yamllint.yml` (`args: [-c, .yamllint.yml]`).
- `actionlint` — GitHub Actions workflow linting (only needed if your repository contains workflow files; on networks that block Go module downloads, the hook's first-run install can fail — CI is the shared enforcement environment in that case).

The repository's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` shows the current pinned versions and exact configuration; copy from there rather than retyping.

### 4. Decide Whether `.jsonc` Needs Stricter Tooling

The default pre-commit stack does **not** validate `.jsonc` syntax — `check-json` is intentionally limited to strict `.json`. Inspect the `.jsonc` files in your repository (for example, `.markdownlint.jsonc` or other tool configurations that ship with a `.jsonc` extension) and decide whether they warrant adding **JSONC-aware tooling** (a JSONC-aware parser, linter, or schema validator). If they are small, well-controlled, and consumed by tools that understand JSONC, no extra tooling is required. If `.jsonc` files are load-bearing, adopt JSONC-aware tooling rather than retrofitting `check-json`. The repository's JSON authoring guide reserves JSONC syntax for files that actually use the `.jsonc` extension; `.json` files **MUST** remain strict JSON, so they are out of scope for this step.

### 5. Add `actionlint` for GitHub Actions

If your repository has any GitHub Actions workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`), keep or add the `actionlint` pre-commit hook. It validates workflow syntax, expression usage, and runner labels, and may also run ShellCheck over `run:` blocks when `shellcheck` is available on the contributor's `PATH`. The default pre-commit hook installs only `actionlint` itself, so ShellCheck coverage of `run:` blocks is conditional on a separate local `shellcheck` install.

### 6. Adopt `schemas/` and `check-jsonschema` Gradually

Schemas are opt-in and **should be added gradually**, only for **load-bearing** files (files whose shape is depended on by build, deploy, runtime, release automation, or downstream consumers).

- Copy the `schemas/` directory (including `schemas/README.md`) only if you intend to define real schemas. The template ships `schemas/` with one clearly removable worked example (`example-config.schema.json` plus example data under `schemas/examples/example-config/`) wired into pre-commit and `data-ci.yml`. If you are not adopting schema-backed validation, follow the [downstream removal checklist](schemas/README.md#downstream-removal-checklist) in `schemas/README.md` to take the worked example out, or skip copying the directory entirely.
- When you add a real schema, add **one `check-jsonschema` hook per real schema-backed file family**, scoped to the files that family covers (for example, `^config/.*\.json$`). See [`schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md) for an illustrative hook example.
- Do **not** add placeholder hooks for schemas that do not yet exist, and do **not** validate every JSON or YAML file by default. `check-json` and `check-yaml` already cover syntax; `check-jsonschema` is for contract checks against specific file families.

> **No docs should imply that all JSON/YAML files require schemas.** Schemas are reserved for load-bearing contracts; most fixtures, examples, and ad-hoc configs do not need them.

### 7. Avoid Ecosystem Validators Unless You Use Those Ecosystems

Adopt ecosystem-specific validators (Kubernetes manifest validators, OpenAPI validators, Helm validators, Ansible validators, and so on) **only** when the repository actually uses those ecosystems. Generic YAML guidance does not require validators that are irrelevant to your stack, and adding them creates noise without enforcing anything useful.

### Notes on Formatting

- **Prettier is opt-in** and is not part of the default pre-commit toolchain. The default stack does not use Prettier on JSON or YAML, and it does **not** rely on Prettier (or any other tool) to sort JSON keys. The JSON authoring guide preserves intentional grouping and tool-managed key order.
- **JSON5 is not enabled by default.** The JSON authoring guide intentionally omits `.json5`. Do not introduce JSON5 without an explicit, documented project decision.

---

## Adopting CI Workflows

The template includes several GitHub Actions workflows. Adopt only the ones relevant to your project.

### Understanding Workflow Dependencies

Before adopting workflows, understand their requirements:

| Workflow | Dependencies | Prerequisites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `markdownlint.yml` | `package.json` with markdownlint-cli2 | Node.js |
| `auto-fix-precommit.yml` | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Python |
| `check-placeholders.yml` | None | Template placeholders in files |
| `python-ci.yml` | Python project structure, `pyproject.toml` | Python |
| `powershell-ci.yml` | PowerShell scripts, Pester tests | PowerShell |
| `data-ci.yml` | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.yamllint.yml` (and, for schema validation, `schemas/`) | Python (for `pre-commit`) |

### Markdown Lint Workflow

**Location:** `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml`

**Purpose:** Enforces consistent Markdown formatting in CI.

**Prerequisites:**

- `markdownlint-cli2` in `package.json`
- `.markdownlint.jsonc` configuration file

**Steps:**

1. Copy `.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml` to your `.github/workflows/` directory
2. The workflow runs automatically on push and pull requests

### Auto-fix Pre-commit Workflow

**Location:** `.github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml`

**Purpose:** Automatically fixes pre-commit issues on `copilot/**` branches. This is useful for AI-assisted development where the Copilot Coding Agent may push code that doesn't pass pre-commit checks.

**Prerequisites:**

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configured

**Steps:**

1. Copy `.github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml` to your `.github/workflows/` directory
2. The workflow triggers only on `copilot/**` branches when pushed by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`

> **Note:** This workflow is optional but recommended if you use GitHub Copilot Coding Agent. If you don't use the Copilot Coding Agent, you can skip adopting this workflow. If you've already adopted it but later decide to remove it, see [Auto-fix Pre-commit Workflow Configuration](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md#auto-fix-pre-commit-workflow-configuration) for removal instructions.

### Placeholder Check Workflow

**Location:** `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml`

**Purpose:** Verifies that `OWNER/REPO` placeholders have been replaced after copying from the template.

**No configuration required.** The workflow:

- Runs automatically on push, pull request, and manual dispatch
- Is already configured to exclude only the original template repository (`franklesniak/copilot-repo-template`)
- Will check your repository for unreplaced placeholders

**Adoption considerations:**

1. **If you copied templates with placeholders:** The workflow will catch any unreplaced placeholders and fail CI until you fix them

2. **After all placeholders are replaced:** You have two options:
   - **Keep the workflow** — It serves as a safety net for any future template updates or additions
   - **Remove the workflow** — Delete `.github/workflows/check-placeholders.yml` if you no longer need placeholder checking

**What the workflow checks:**

- `OWNER/REPO` in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (contact links URLs)
- `OWNER/REPO` in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (clone URL and issues link)
- `@OWNER` in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `[security contact email]` and `TODO: Replace` in `SECURITY.md`
- `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO` URLs in any file under `.github/`

### Python CI Workflow

**Location:** `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`

**Purpose:** Runs pre-commit hooks, type checking (mypy), and tests (pytest) for Python code.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python code in `src/` directory (or update `MYPY_PATHS`)
- Tests in `tests/` directory
- `pyproject.toml` with `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` section containing test dependencies

**Steps:**

1. Copy `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` to your `.github/workflows/` directory

2. **Update paths if needed:**

   If your Python code is in a different location, update the `MYPY_PATHS` environment variable:

   ```yaml
   env:
     MYPY_PATHS: "your_package/ tests/"  # Change from "src/ tests/"
   ```

3. **Update pytest path if needed:**

   ```yaml
   run: pytest your_tests_directory/ -v --cov --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

**If you have existing Python CI:**

- Compare your workflow with the template
- Consider adding specific checks from the template as additional jobs
- The template's job dependency pattern (`needs: pre-commit`) ensures tests don't run on poorly-formatted code

#### If You Already Have pyproject.toml

If your Python project already has a `pyproject.toml` file, you'll need to ensure it includes the required configuration for the CI workflow to pass successfully.

**Required Development Dependencies:**

The CI workflow expects certain development dependencies to be installed. Add these to your `pyproject.toml` if not already present:

| Dependency | Minimum Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pytest` | `>=8.0.0` | Running tests in the CI workflow |
| `pytest-cov` | `>=4.0` | Generating test coverage reports |
| `mypy` | `>=1.0` | Type checking Python code |
| `ruff` | `>=0.9.0` | Code linting and formatting (installed automatically by pre-commit, but useful for local development) |

**Adding Development Dependencies:**

Add or merge the `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in your existing `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    # Required for CI workflow:
    "pytest>=8.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.0",
    "mypy>=1.0",
    # Include your existing dev dependencies as well
    # "your-existing-dependency>=1.0.0",
]
```

> **Note:** If you already have a `dev` extras section, merge these dependencies with your existing ones.

**Adding mypy Configuration:**

The CI workflow runs mypy for type checking. Add the `[tool.mypy]` section if not present:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.13"  # Match your project's requires-python version
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = false  # Start permissive, tighten later as you add type hints
```

> **Tip:** Start with `disallow_untyped_defs = false` to avoid errors on untyped functions. You can tighten this requirement as your project matures and you add more type annotations.

**Adding pytest Configuration:**

Add the `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section to configure test discovery:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]  # Adjust to match your test directory location
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
```

> **Note:** See [Using the Python Template Files](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md#using-the-python-template-files) for more comprehensive Python configuration options, including Black and Ruff tool settings.

### PowerShell CI Workflow

**Location:** `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml`

**Purpose:** Runs PSScriptAnalyzer linting and Pester tests for PowerShell scripts.

**Prerequisites:**

- PowerShell scripts (`.ps1` files)
- Pester tests (`.Tests.ps1` files) for the test job

**Steps:**

1. Copy `.github/workflows/powershell-ci.yml` to your `.github/workflows/` directory

2. Copy `.github/linting/PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` for consistent linting

3. **Update paths if needed:**

   If your PowerShell files are in different locations, update the find commands in the workflow.

   If your Pester tests aren't in `tests/`, update the configuration:

   ```powershell
   $config.Run.Path = "your_tests_directory/"
   ```

### Data CI Workflow

**Location:** `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml`

**Purpose:** Runs the data-file pre-commit hooks (`check-json`, `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, `actionlint`, and the worked-example `check-jsonschema` and `check-metaschema` hooks) as a dedicated check that can be required via branch protection independent of the Python CI job.

**Prerequisites:**

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the data-file hooks configured
- `.yamllint.yml` at the repository root
- For schema validation: `schemas/<name>.schema.json` plus matching `schemas/examples/<name>/{valid,invalid}/` fixtures

**Steps:**

1. Copy `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml` to your `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. Read the top-of-file comment in `.github/workflows/data-ci.yml` for how it differs from `.github/workflows/auto-fix-precommit.yml` (the auto-fix workflow only runs on `copilot/**` branches and commits fixes; the data CI workflow enforces the hooks on every push and PR without committing).
3. The workflow runs automatically on push and pull requests; no per-file configuration is required as long as the pre-commit hooks themselves are scoped correctly.

**Caveat — `check-jsonschema` and `check-metaschema` steps run unconditionally.** `data-ci.yml` invokes `pre-commit run check-jsonschema --all-files` and `pre-commit run check-metaschema --all-files` as dedicated steps. If you adopt `data-ci.yml` but do **not** keep both hook IDs configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, those steps will fail with `pre-commit: No hook with id ...`. Two safe paths forward:

1. **Keep schema validation:** retain (or repurpose) the `check-jsonschema` and `check-metaschema` hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and provide your own schema(s) and example fixture(s) at `schemas/<name>.schema.json` plus `schemas/examples/<name>/{valid,invalid}/`.
2. **Drop schema validation entirely:** remove the `check-jsonschema` and `check-metaschema` steps from `data-ci.yml` (and the corresponding hooks from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) so the workflow does not invoke missing hook IDs. See [`schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md) for the canonical removal checklist for the worked example.

`check-json`, `check-yaml`, `yamllint`, and `actionlint` are repository-agnostic and remain useful even without a worked-example schema, so the corresponding `data-ci.yml` steps can be kept regardless of which path above you take.

### Merging with Existing CI

If you already have CI workflows:

1. **Don't blindly overwrite** — Review what your current CI does

2. **Add template checks as additional jobs:**

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     existing-job:
       # Your existing job
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps: [...]

     # Add this from the template
     pre-commit:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps: [...]
   ```

3. **Consider matrix builds** — The template uses matrix builds for cross-platform testing. If not already doing this, consider adopting the pattern:

   ```yaml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
   ```

---

## Adopting PSScriptAnalyzer Configuration

PSScriptAnalyzer is a static code checker for PowerShell. The template includes a configuration file that enforces OTBS (One True Brace Style) formatting.

### Copying the Configuration

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist:

   **Windows (PowerShell):**

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path .github\linting -Force
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/linting
   ```

2. Copy `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` to `.github/linting/`

### Using the Configuration

**Check PowerShell files:**

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path .\your-script.ps1 -Settings .\.github\linting\PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
```

**Auto-fix formatting issues:**

```powershell
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path .\your-script.ps1 -Settings .\.github\linting\PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1 -Fix
```

**Check all PowerShell files in a directory:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Filter "*.ps1" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path $_.FullName -Settings .\.github\linting\PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
}
```

### Customizing Rules

Review the rules in `PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1` and adjust as needed:

**Key configurable rules:**

| Rule | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PSPlaceOpenBrace` | Same line | OTBS brace placement |
| `PSUseConsistentIndentation` | 4 spaces | Indentation style |
| `PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters` | Enabled | Enforce named parameters |
| `PSProvideCommentHelp` | Enabled | Require help comments |

**To disable a rule:**

```powershell
PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters = @{
    Enable = $false
}
```

---

## Validation and Testing

Before considering adoption complete, verify that all configurations work correctly.

### Verify All Configurations Work

**1. Pre-commit (if adopted):**

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Expected result: All hooks should pass, or you should understand and have addressed any failures.

**2. Markdown linting (if adopted):**

```bash
npm run lint:md
```

Expected result: No errors, or only warnings you've chosen to accept.

**3. Push to feature branch:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: adopt template configurations from copilot-repo-template"
git push origin feature/adopt-template-features
```

**4. Verify CI workflows:**

- Navigate to your repository's **Actions** tab
- Check that all adopted workflows run
- Fix any failures before merging

**5. Test issue templates (if adopted):**

- Navigate to **Issues** → **New Issue**
- Verify all templates appear correctly
- Open a test issue with each template to verify form fields work
- Verify links in the template chooser (`config.yml`) work
- Close test issues without saving (or delete after testing)

**6. Test PR template (if adopted):**

- Open a test pull request (can be against your feature branch)
- Verify the template renders correctly with all sections
- Close without merging

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow fails with "file not found" | Different project structure | Update paths in workflow file |
| Pre-commit downloads every time | Environment cache issue | Run `pre-commit clean && pre-commit install` |
| Markdown lint finds many errors | Stricter rules than before | Adjust `.markdownlint.jsonc` or fix files |
| Python CI fails on imports | Different package structure | Update `MYPY_PATHS` in workflow |
| PSScriptAnalyzer fails | Code doesn't match OTBS style | Run with `-Fix` or adjust settings |
| npm install fails | Node.js version mismatch | Update Node.js to v20+ (see `engines` in package.json) |
| Placeholder check fails | OWNER/REPO not replaced | Search and replace all placeholders |

## Cleanup and Documentation

### Files to Review After Adoption

**Files you may want to delete after adoption:**

- If you cloned the template separately, delete the clone directory
- `templates/` directory — Only useful if your project is also a template

**Files you should keep:**

- All configuration files you adopted (`.markdownlint.jsonc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, etc.)
- All workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- Copilot instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/`)
- `.github/TEMPLATE_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` — Template design rationale (useful during setup to understand why configurations were made; can be deleted after review if not needed)

### Updating Your Project Documentation

**Update CONTRIBUTING.md:**

If you adopted the template's `CONTRIBUTING.md`, you should:

1. **Remove the "For Template Users" section** — This section (starting with `## For Template Users`) contains meta-instructions about the template itself. Delete it along with the HTML comment above it for non-template projects.

2. **Replace `OWNER/REPO` placeholders** — Update with your actual organization and repository name in clone instructions and issue links.

3. **Add pre-commit setup instructions** (if you adopted pre-commit):

````markdown
## Development Setup

Before making changes, install pre-commit hooks:

**Option 1: Using pipx (recommended)**

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
python -m pipx install pre-commit
```

After running the above, restart your terminal, then run:

```powershell
pre-commit install
```

macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pipx
# Or use your OS package manager: sudo apt install pipx, brew install pipx, etc.
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
python3 -m pipx install pre-commit
```

After running the above, restart your terminal, then run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

**Option 2: Using pip (if you can't use pipx)**

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install pre-commit
# Use module invocation (avoids PATH issues):
python -m pre_commit install
```

macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
# Use module invocation (avoids PATH issues):
python3 -m pre_commit install
```

Pre-commit hooks will automatically run on each commit. You can also run them manually:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or if `pre-commit` is not on PATH:

```powershell
python -m pre_commit run --all-files
```

**macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:**

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or if `pre-commit` is not on PATH:

```bash
python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files
```
````

See [OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md) for additional `CONTRIBUTING.md` customization guidance.

**Update README.md:**

> **Note:** Do NOT copy the template's `README.md` to your existing repository. The template's README is designed for new repositories created from the template and contains template-specific documentation that would not apply to your repository. Your existing README should remain intact.

Instead, update your existing README to document any new development requirements you've adopted:

````markdown
## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (for markdown linting)
- Python 3.9+ (for pre-commit hooks)
- PowerShell (for PSScriptAnalyzer)

### Setup

Install markdown linting tools:

```bash
npm install
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

**Option 1: Using pipx (recommended)**

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
python -m pipx install pre-commit
```

After running the above, restart your terminal, then run:

```powershell
pre-commit install
```

macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pipx
# Or use your OS package manager: sudo apt install pipx, brew install pipx, etc.
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
python3 -m pipx install pre-commit
```

After running the above, restart your terminal, then run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

**Option 2: Using pip (if you can't use pipx)**

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install pre-commit
# Use module invocation (avoids PATH issues):
python -m pre_commit install
```

macOS/Linux/FreeBSD:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
# Use module invocation (avoids PATH issues):
python3 -m pre_commit install
```
````

Consider adding sections for:

- Pre-commit hook requirements (if adopted)
- Linting commands (e.g., `npm run lint:md`)
- CI workflow expectations

**Notify your team:**

Consider informing collaborators about:

- New pre-commit requirements
- CI workflow changes
- New issue/PR templates

## Migration Notes for Existing Terraform Repos

If you are adopting this template into an existing Terraform repository, follow this step-by-step checklist to ensure a smooth migration:

### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Baseline current state:** Run `terraform plan` and save the output. This gives you a baseline to verify no unintended changes occur after migration.
- [ ] **Commit any pending changes:** Ensure your working tree is clean before starting migration.

### Alignment Checklist

- [ ] **Align `versions.tf`:** Ensure your `versions.tf` follows the template's format with explicit `required_version` and `required_providers` blocks:

  ```hcl
  terraform {
    required_version = ">= 1.6.0"

    required_providers {
      aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "~> 5.0"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Update `.terraform.lock.hcl`:** Regenerate your lock file to include hashes for all platforms used in CI:

  ```bash
  terraform providers lock \
    -platform=linux_amd64 \
    -platform=darwin_amd64 \
    -platform=darwin_arm64
  ```

- [ ] **Commit `.terraform.lock.hcl`:** Ensure the lock file is tracked in version control.

### Formatting and Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Run `terraform fmt -recursive`:** Format all Terraform files to match the template's style.
- [ ] **Run `terraform validate`:** Ensure all configurations are syntactically valid.
- [ ] **Run `tflint`:** Use the template's `.tflint.hcl` configuration to lint your code:

  ```bash
  tflint --recursive
  ```

- [ ] **Fix any issues:** Address formatting, validation, and linting errors before proceeding.

### Refactoring Checklist

If you need to rename resources or restructure your configuration:

- [ ] **Use `moved` blocks for renames:** Instead of manual state manipulation, use declarative `moved` blocks:

  ```hcl
  moved {
    from = aws_instance.old_name
    to   = aws_instance.new_name
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Use `import` blocks for existing resources:** Bring unmanaged resources into Terraform using `import` blocks (Terraform 1.5+):

  ```hcl
  import {
    to = aws_instance.example
    id = "i-1234567890abcdef0"
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Use `removed` blocks when appropriate:** Remove resources from state without destroying them using `removed` blocks (Terraform 1.7+):

  ```hcl
  removed {
    from = aws_instance.legacy_server

    lifecycle {
      destroy = false  # Remove from state without destroying
    }
  }
  ```

### Documentation Checklist

- [ ] **Document deviations:** If your repository deviates from the template's Terraform standards, document these in the **Scope Exceptions & Deviations from Standards** section of `.github/instructions/terraform.instructions.md`.
- [ ] **Update README:** Document any Terraform-specific setup requirements for your repository.

### Post-Migration Verification

- [ ] **Run `terraform plan`:** Compare against your pre-migration baseline. There should be no unexpected changes.
- [ ] **Run CI workflows:** Verify all GitHub Actions workflows pass.
- [ ] **Test in a non-production environment:** If possible, apply changes to a test environment before production.

## Next Steps

After adopting template features, you may want to explore additional customization options:

- **[Optional Configurations](OPTIONAL_CONFIGURATIONS.md)**: Fine-tune your repository with optional settings like enabling GitHub Discussions, adjusting Dependabot frequency, customizing linting rules, and more.

---

## Summary Checklist
